## Why?

I've started using StackOverflow more actively by answering questions, editing posts and flags posts/answers. My goal
is to keep learning new things, mastering ones that I already now and help other people learning and finding
the best answers and solutions to their problems.

If you are a **passive** StackOverflow user I strongly encourage you to start participating actively in this great community
of software developers all kind - juniors, seniors and masters.
